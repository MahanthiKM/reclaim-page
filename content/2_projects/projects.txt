Project1_description : In our little witches garden, part of the Rote Beete Gemeinschaftsgarten in Wedding, we see the soil as a fertile ground for an activist and political approach. We grow vegetables and medicinal plants, as a way to not only reclaim our connection to nature but also foster exchanges and dialogues with local communities.
